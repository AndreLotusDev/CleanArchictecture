# Clean Architecture

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Clean Architecture in a C# project. Clean Architecture, proposed by Robert C. Martin, is aimed at organizing code in such a way that it encapsulates the business logic but keeps it separate from interfaces and infrastructure.

## Key Concepts of Clean Architecture

- **Independent of Frameworks:** The architecture does not depend on the existence of some library or framework. This allows for easy framework upgrades.
- **Testable:** The business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web Server, or any external element.
- **Independent of UI:** The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the system.
- **Independent of Database:** Business rules are not bound to the database.
- **Independent of any external agency:** Business rules donâ€™t know anything at all about the outside world.

## Structure

This project is divided into the following layers:

1. **Entities Layer:** Contains enterprise-wide business rules.
2. **Use Cases Layer:** Contains application-specific business rules.
3. **Interface Adapters Layer:** Converts data from the format most convenient for use cases and entities.
4. **Frameworks & Drivers Layer:** Contains frameworks and tools such as databases and web servers.

## Best Practices in C#

- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Persistence Ignorance:** Business entities should be agnostic to the persistence layer.
- **Encapsulation:** Keeping data and the methods that modify that data together.
- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for business logic without relying on external elements like databases or web services.
- **Use of Interfaces:** Facilitates decoupling of components and improves testability.
- **Repository Pattern:** Encapsulate the logic required to access data sources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the solution file and open it in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Restore NuGet packages.
4. Build the solution.
5. Run unit tests to ensure everything is set up correctly.
